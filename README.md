# Basic control infrastructure for eDVS (embedded Dynamic Vision Sensor) equipped PushBot robots. #

## TODO ##
* port edvs and cmd and control interfaces 
* add emergency stop (bypass) user function if failing
* add simple command interface (e.g. keys and mouse / gamepad)
* single event vs. event frame as input for user functions
* sync inertial sensory data (i.e. gyro, acc, mag) with events and provide only high-level info (i.e. RPY information)
* Linux and mswin compatibility using Qt5 and pack all needed library in stand-alone deliverable
